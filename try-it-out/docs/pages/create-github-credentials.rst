Create Jenkins Credentials for GitHub
-------------------------------------

On this page, you will be creating some `Jenkins credentials`_ for your Jenkins instance to be able to connect to GitHub much faster
than if you otherwise didn't do so.

.. _Jenkins credentials: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/

The things you do on this page are **optional** as the GitHub repositories that we are using throughout this lab are all public, however, we 
definitely recommend doing it so that the time it takes to build the sample application in Jenkins on the next page is much faster. 


=====================================
Create a GitHub Personal Access Token
=====================================

To begin, you will need to create a GitHub Personal Acccess Token by following the guide `here`_.

.. _here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/

The token should have all permissions given to it except for the permission to delete the repository.

.. note:: 

    Donâ€™t forget to save this token in some place where you can easily access it in case you need it in the future,
    otherwise, you may need to create a new one if you lose it.

==============================
Adding a Credential to Jenkins
==============================

You will now be adding your personal GitHub credentials to your Jenkins instance as a Jenkins credential.

Navigate to the configuration page for the Jenkins job that we already created for you: http://localhost:8080/job/sample-spring-boot-api/configure

On the top of the page, click the **Branch Sources** tab and click the button labeled **Add** with a blue key next to it on the row
labeled **Credentials**.

In the dropdown that follows, select **Jenkins**.

In the popup that appears, do the following:

    - Leave the **Domain** field untouched so that the value is ``Global credentials (unrestricted)``
    - Leave the **Kind** field untouched so that the value is ``Username with Password``
    - For the **Username** field, enter the username of your GitHub account
    - For the **Password** field, enter the value of your Personal Access Token you created in the last step
    - For the **ID** and the **Description** fields, enter ``github``
    - Click the **Add** button when you're done entering the above information

Now that you created the Jenkins credential to store your Github information, you can now use it. To do so, click the **Credentials** dropdown
and select the ``github`` credential.

On the top of the page, click the **Jenkins Templating Engine** tab.

Click the **Credentials** dropdown and select the ``github`` credential within the **Source Location** and the **Library Sources** sections
as shown in the areas highlighted in red in the following screenshot.

When you're done with everything, click on the **Save** button on the bottom of the page.

Finally, you will be running the Jenkins build on the next page and seeing the fruits of your labor. Let's continue!
