=======================
Environment Preparation
=======================

In this section, you will be deploying all of the DevOps tools that we will be using throughout this tutorial. 
The following table lists each tool that will be used and their general purpose.

.. csv-table:: DevOps Tooling
   :align: center 
   :header: "Tool", "Description"

    "`(Insecure) Docker Registry`_", "Container Image Registry used to store and retrieve Docker images"
    "`Jenkins`_", "An open-source CI/CD server used to execute the pipeline"
    "`SonarQube Server`_", "A static code analysis tool used to scan code for potential security vulnerabilities, bugs, and code smells"

.. _(Insecure) Docker Registry: https://docs.docker.com/registry/
.. _Jenkins: https://jenkins.io/
.. _SonarQube Server: https://www.sonarqube.org/about/

.. note:: 

    The tools that we will be utilizing throughout this tutorial are not fully secure
    or highly available and thus **not production-ready**. Their configuration in this 
    lab is meant strictly for local development to try out SDP.  

---------------------------------------------
Step 1: Register The Insecure Docker Registry
---------------------------------------------

To push and pull images from the local registry to be deployed, you'll need to register it as 
an insecure registry on your machine.  Modify your docker preferences to add 
``0.0.0.0:5000`` as an insecure registry. 

Follow the instructions under the section labeled "Deploy a plain HTTP registry" found 
`here <https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/#deploy-a-plain-http-registry>`_.

.. note:: 
    
    The URL of the Docker registry should **not** be preceded by ``http://`` when 
    being added to the list of insecure registries.

Make sure to apply the changes and restart your docker daemon in order for these 
changes to take effect. 

------------------------
Step 2: Deploy The Tools 
------------------------

We'll be using `docker compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_ to deploy these tools locally. 

Run the following command in your terminal from the root directory of the ``sdp-labs`` repository
to deploy the Docker containers using the provided docker-compose.yaml file within the ``try-it-out`` 
directory. 

.. code-block:: bash

   docker-compose -f ./try-it-out/docker-compose.yaml up --build -d --scale sonar-scanner=0

.. note:: 

    The ``docker-compose`` command run above may not work on Booz Allen's WiFi depending on its 
    firewall settings, so you may need to run it on a private network or where firewall rules are more lax. 

The above command will create and run the following Docker containers: 
Jenkins, a Docker registry, and SonarQube.

-------------------------------
Step 3: Validate the Deployment
-------------------------------

Let's verify that each tool was successfully deployed. 

**Docker Registry**

    | Navigate `here <http://localhost:5000/v2/_catalog>`_. 
    | You should see the following screen:

    .. image:: ../images/deploy-devops-tools/docker_registry.png

**Jenkins**

    | Navigate `here <http://localhost:8080>`_. 
    | You should see the following screen:

    .. image:: ../images/deploy-devops-tools/jenkins.png

**SonarQube Server**

    | Navigate `here <http://localhost:9000>`_. 
    | You should see the following screen:

    .. image:: ../images/deploy-devops-tools/sonarqube.png

.. important:: 

    If any of these services are not working as expected you can check out the 
    :ref:`troubleshooting <try-it-out troubleshooting>` page for common problems 
    and their fixes.

------------------------------------
Step 4: Clone the Sample Application
------------------------------------ 

To begin, clone our `SDP Learning Labs <https://github.com/boozallen/sdp-labs>`_ GitHub repository,
which includes all of the files you'll need to use throughout this lab. 

.. code-block:: bash

   ## cloning via ssh
   git clone git@github.com:boozallen/sdp-labs.git

   ## cloning via https
   git clone https://github.com/boozallen/sdp-labs.git

In your terminal, navigate to the ``sdp-labs`` directory that you just cloned from GitHub.
